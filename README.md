# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of automating the election audit process using Python. Ideally, if successful this process can be applied to other elections going forward. 

In particular, the audit will show the following: 
1. The total number of votes cast. 
2. The number and percentage of votes for each candidate, total and by county. 
3. The county with the largest turnout.
4. The winner of the election, including their number and percentage of votes. 

## Resources

* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6; Visual Studio Code 1.50.1

## Summary 

The following results were attained using the new election audit approach:
* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election. 
* The candidates were as follows:
  * Charles Casper Stockham
  * Diana DeGette
  * Raymon Anthony Doane
* The results were as follows:
  * Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes, or 23.0% of the votes
  * Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, or 73.8% of the votes
  * Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes, or 3.1% of the votes
* The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 272,892 votes, or 73.8% of the votes.

## Going Forward 

A review of this project suggests that this election audit approach works well and, with modifications, can be used for any election going forward. For example, the approach can accommodate any level of election, whether statewide, congressional district, county, local, or other. In addition, although this election had only three candidates this new approach can account for any number of candidates.
